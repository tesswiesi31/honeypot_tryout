  <p>ack is a curious little inventor who can turn anything into a gadget. 
    He once made a “robot dog” using cardboard, tape, and an old flashlight. 
    His room is always full of gears, LEGO parts, and wild ideas. 
    If you hear tiny explosions of laughter and the sound of whirring motors, Jack is probably testing another “brilliant” experiment.</p>
